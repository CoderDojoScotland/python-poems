# python-poems

Remix poems by replacing the word at the end of each line with a rhyming word.
The example poem is [Tam o' Shanter](http://www.robertburns.org.uk/Assets/Poems_Songs/tamoshanter.htm) by Robert Burns.

### Requirements
You'll need the [Pronouncing library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pronouncing). This library is a simple interface for the [Carnegie Mellon University Pronouncing Dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict).

Install with pip:
```shell
pip install pronouncing
```
